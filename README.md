#### What is the purpose of this mod?
In the base game, the only nation which can create puppets from decisions is Germany with its Reichskommissariats. This mod attempts to address this, by adding new formable puppets which nations can create if they occupy certain states. The newly added puppets have a custom autonomy level named "Military Administration" which mirrors the effects of the base game "Reichskommissariat".
#### What are the current formable puppets?
Arabia, Baltic, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, Caribbean, Central Africa, Central America, Central Russia, Chile, Colombia, Danube, East Africa, Eastern Canada, East Germany, Far East Russia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain and Ireland, Greece, Himalayas, Iberia, Indochina, Indonesia, Mexico, Midwestern U.S, Mittelafrika, Mongolia, Netherlands, North Africa, Northeastern U.., Northern Caucasus, North Germany, Northwestern Russia, Oceania, Pacific U.S, Peru, Poland-Lithuania, Prussia, Quebec, Rio de la Plata, Scandinavia, Siberia, South Africa, South Asia, Southern Russia, Southern U.S, South Germany, Transcaucasia, Turkestan, U.S, Rockies, Urals, Volga, West Africa, Western Canada, Western Russia, West Germany, Yugoslavia
#### Current Features:

- Addition of a new autonomy level, "Military Administration", which matches the effects of a Reichskommissariat.

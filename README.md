#### What is the purpose of this mod?
In the base game, the only nation which can create puppets from decisions is Germany with its Reichskommissariats. This mod attempts to address this, by adding new formable puppets which nations can create if they occupy certain states. The newly added puppets have a custom autonomy level named "Military Administration" which mirrors the effects of the base game "Reichskommissariat".
#### Current Features:
- Ability to release up to 76 puppets through new decisions which are highlighted on the map.
- Addition of a new autonomy level, "Military Administration", which matches the effects of a Reichskommissariat.
- Addition of a puppet management menu in decisions which can alter a puppet's leader, ruling party, and territory.
- Ability to appoint a military leader as head of the puppet's government (currently works for Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, United States).
- Ability to change the puppet's ideology if it does not match the overlord.
- Ability to hand back most territory through decisions which are highlighted on the map to create your desired borders.
#### Current Compatibility?
As this modification targets vanilla state IDs, any other mod that adds/modifies states will be incompatible (ex. Beautiful States, Satisfying States).\
